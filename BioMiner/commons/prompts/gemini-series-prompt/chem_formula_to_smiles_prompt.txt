Finish the task below as truthfully as possible.

Task: Apply mapping rule to incorrect molecule strings to correct SMILES.

You should pay attention:

1. If the mapping available, you should return a SMILES with an asterisk (“*”) at the beginning of the output string to denote the point where the fragment attaches to the rest of the molecule.
2. If no mapping is defined for an input, the result is the empty string ("").
3. You should pre-justify the existence of some abbreviations. Here are some examples, you should memorize the rules wisely and learn to apply: "Me" is "C", "Et" is "CC", "nPr" is "CCC", "iPr" is "C(C)C", "nBu" is "CCCC", "iBu" is "CC(C)C", "sBu" is "C(C)CC", "tBu" is "C(C)(C)C", "nAm" is "CCCCC", "iAm" is "CCC(C)C", "sAm" is "C(C)CCC", "tAm" is "C(C)(C)CC", "CHO" is "C=O", "Ac" is "C(=O)C", "COEt" is "C(=O)CC"， "COO-" is "C(=O)[O-]", "CONMe2" is "C(=O)N(C)C", "CN" is "C#N", "CF2CF3" is "C(F)(F)C(F)(F)F", "CCl3" is "C(Cl)(Cl)Cl", "Tf" is "S(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F", "Tos" is "S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C)cc1", "Boc" is "C(=O)OC(C)(C)C", "Ph" is "c1ccccc1", "Bn" is "Cc1ccccc1", "Bz" is"C(=O)c1ccccc1", "Cbz" is "C(=O)OCc1ccccc1".
4. All explicit hydrogen letters in the output are omitted (e.g. “CH3” is treated as “C” so that no “H” appears).
5. The outputs resemble SMILES/SMARTS fragments where connectivity and bond types (like double bonds in carbonyls or charges in nitro and azide groups) are explicitly indicated
6. Some groups appear in multiple forms (e.g., "NH2" and "-NH2" both map to "*N"; "CH3", "Me", and "-Me" all map to "*C"), suggesting that the notation may vary in the input but is normalized in the output.
7. If an input sidechain is expressed as a very long alkyl chain (for example, with a notation like “(CH2)21CH3” or any chain exceeding a predetermined maximum length), no mapping is defined.
8. For the methoxy substituent, the order of atoms must remain as given. In the original rule the mapping for "OCH₃" was produced as *CO, but it must be *OC instead.
9. If an input string contains multiple sidechains (for example, several substituents separated by commas, like "3-F, 4-Me", "p-C6H4F, CH2OTBS, CH3"), then the mapping is undefined because only one sidechain is allowed per mapping operation.
10. If an input begins with a number and a hyphen (or numbers separated by commas then a hyphen), the numeric “junction” is removed and the remainder is mapped according to the standard rules. For example, "3-F" becomes “F” → mapped as *F, "5-COOH" becomes “COOH” → mapped as *C(=O)O, "4-Me" becomes “Me” → mapped as *C
11. If the input substituent string is already written in a valid SMILES‐like format (i.e. it already contains the desired atomic connectivity and no explicit hydrogens are present), then do not change the string at all. In other words, return the exact same string as the mapping result. Examples: "CCN(C)C" maps to "CCN(C)C", "CCCN(C)C" maps to "CCCN(C)C".

Here are some cases, you should learn how to apply the rules and add more rules if you need.
