Task: Recognizing the identifier for every molecule within the plotted red box in provided picture.

Instructions:

1. This picture is a page of a scientific paper.

2. In the figure, there are some 2D molecule structures. We plot red boxes for detected molecules. Each red box has an box index (red number) on the left top corner. 

3. For each 2D molecule structure, their usually exist identifier as the coreference for this moleucle in the paper.

4. We already have employed optical molecule structure recognition model to recognize the SMILES of the detected molecules.

5. At this time, we want align the molecule SMILES and identifier in the paper by the box index.

6. Therefore, you need to recognize the identifier for each detected molecule (in the red box).

7. Please outputing the results in this json format: "json```[{"index": "box index of the detected molecule", "identifier": "coreference of the molecule in the paper"}]```"

8. The box index of detected molecules are: <index></index>. Therefore, in the result, the box index must be in them.
