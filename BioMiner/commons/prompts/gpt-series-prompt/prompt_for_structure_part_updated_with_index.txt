Task: Extracting R-group for each molecular scaffold.

Instructions:

1. Identify Scaffolds and R-groups:

Locate the red boxes in the image and note the artificial index (red number) in the top-left corner.
Classify each structure in the red box as either a molecular scaffold or an R-group.
For each scaffold, identify all associated R-groups. A complete molecule consists of one scaffold and one or more R-groups.

2. R-group Naming:

Name R-groups based on their position (e.g., R1, R2, R3, X, Y) as indicated in the image or table.
If an R-group is not in a red box, provide its chemical expression.

3. Output Format:
Use the following JSON format for each scaffold and its R-groups:
"{"data": [{"scaffold": "artificial index of scaffold","R-group": {"name of R-group1": "artificial index of R-group1 or chemical expression",...},"identifier": "compound identifier from the table or image"}]}"

4. Additional Notes:

Ensure that the scaffold and R-group indices match those in the image.
Map the compound identifiers from the table to the corresponding structures in the image.

5. For scaffolds and R-groups that are not text-format, their artifical index must in the following indexs: <index></index>
