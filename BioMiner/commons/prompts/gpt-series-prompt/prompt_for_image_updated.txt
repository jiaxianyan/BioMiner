Task: Extract all protein-ligand binding affinity data from the provided image.

Instructions:

1. The provided image is from a scientific literature. Extract protein-ligand binding affinity data from the image.

2. Protein-ligand affinity data consists of three components:
    Protein: The name of the protein.
    Ligand: The ligand coreference in the paper.
    Affinity: The affinity measurement, which includes:
        (1) Type: One of "IC50", "Kd", or "Ki".
        (2) Value: The numerical value of the affinity measurement.
        (3) Unit: The unit of the affinity measurement (e.g., nM, ÂµM, mM).

3. Output the extracted data in the following JSON format strictly:"{"data": [{"protein": "protein name", "ligand": "ligand coreference" , "affinity": {"type": "ki/kd/ic50", "value": "affinity value", "unit": "affinity unit"}}]}"

4. Only consider protein-ligand binding affinity measurements of type "IC50", "Kd", or "Ki". Ignore other types of affinity measurements.
